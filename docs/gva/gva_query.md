## gva query

Queries the Gun Violence Archive

### Synopsis

Queries and prints comma-separated values. The Gun Violence Archive places opaque limits on the number of records returned for large queries, so your results may be artificially truncated for large queries.

  -h, --help              help for query
      --in-state string   Specify a state to filter results by
      --to string         Specify the end date to filter results by (inclusive)
  -u, --url string        Specify a URL to use as the root for accessing the API (default "https://www.gunviolencearchive.org")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -v, --verbose   Enable verbose logging
```
